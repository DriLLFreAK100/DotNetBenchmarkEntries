# About The Repo

This project is intended for testing and demystifying **patterns** in .NET that might have performance impacts.

`Debunking Misbelieves` shall be the motto of this repo. Instead of following "cults" and common misbelieves, I thought it might be better to just write some benchmarks and let the metrics talk instead.

# Project Structure

No fixed structure at the moment. However, each `benchmark` should be a standalone project at this point in time for simplicity sake.
